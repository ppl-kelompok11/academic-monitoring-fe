      "Over the last few decades, the development of supporting natural tourism infrastructure has been growing. Tourism development should have a multiplier effect in the social, cultural, economic, and environmental sectors, each of which benefits the local community around the tourism areas. In practice, the local communities continue to experience negative consequences. This is due to its inability to fully implement urban and regional planning theory and the concept of sustainable tourism, two elements that are essential for long-term community impact.",

When the education system isnâ€™t committed to providing equal opportunities and privileges, it negatively impacts a society both culturally and economically.",

As information and communication technologies advance, this phenomena is having a significant impact especially on work field opportunities for Indonesia's human resources. Such as the emergence of massive layoffs because many industries almost do not need human labor, causing the unemployment rate to increase. It's about us learning and managing to utilize technology other than the opposite.",
